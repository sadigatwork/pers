# Prompt to Develop PHP by AI
## Requirements
I am working on PHP application and would like to generate a requirements document. The system is a client documents management system. Each user should be able to securely log in, access documents and text associated with their account, and post their own documents and text. The documents can be images, pdfs, and standard office documents. Can you help me generate a requirements document based on that? What am I missing?
Thanks! Based on my description; are there any major features I have not considered?
That great! Let us consider them part of the project!
## Use Cases
We should also come up with some use cases for the application, what are some basic use cases we should consider?
Since the system allows for text-based communication between a user and a coach, let's come up with a use case for direct messaging.
## User Stories
Can you generate some user stories for the system we have described so far?
Add this story to our list: Abby is a weight loss coach, As coach, she wants to send automated check-ins to her clients, so that she can help them be accountable.
This is great! Can you summarize the system we have built so far, taking all the requirements, features, use cases, and user stories into account, then create a new requirements document from it?
## Features
Can you take these stories and convert them into a comperhensive feature list for me?
Can you take these features and turn them into a requirements document? The system will build with PHP and MySQL and use HTML and CSS, with Javascript. The installation file should build the database, which may require the user to create a database.
## Timelines
If I wanted to create a general timeline for this project, could you help me with that? Please create a 4-month, 6-month, and 12-month timeline for this project.
I fear you misunderstood me. I'd like timeline where the entire project can be completed in 4 months, 6 months, or 12 months.
Consider we use agile approach and not waterfall approach
Can you build an extra time to each of these timelines for unforeseen circumstances?
I really like the 6 months standard timeline with some buffer time build-in. Can you format that timeline into a table with specific dates, assuming the project kicks off on July 1st.
Great! Can you turn this table into a Gantt chart?

## Requirement
I am working on PHP application and would like to generate a requirements document. The system is a Professional registration management app for agricultural engineers. Each user should be able to register and securely log in, access his profile and record his university degrees, training courses, work experience and academic papers. He will obtain a professional degree based on the certificates and experiences he has obtained in addition to years of experience. Can you help me generate a requirements document based on that? What am I missing?
## Use Cases
We should also come up with some use cases for the application, what are some basic use cases we should consider?
