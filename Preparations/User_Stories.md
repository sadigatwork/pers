### **Next Steps**  
1. Should we:  
   - [ ] Prioritize stories into sprints?  
   - [ ] Add story points for estimation?  
   - [ ] Define personas (e.g., "Early-Career Engineer")?  

2. Need any of these expanded into:  
   - Detailed acceptance criteria?  
   - UI mockups for key flows?  
   - API contract samples?  

These user stories cover end-to-end workflows while addressing agricultural engineering specifics. Let me know how you'd like to refine or expand them!


Hereâ€™s the new user story integrated into your systemâ€™s documentation, with expanded context and technical considerations:

### **New User Story: Junior Engineer Registration**  
**US-21: Entry-Level Registration**  
*As Adam, a newly graduated agricultural engineer, I want to register as an "Entry Junior" member so I can start building my professional profile while gaining experience.*  

#### **Key Details**  
- **User Type:** Early-career professional (0-2 years experience)  
- **Special Requirements:**  
  - Reduced registration fee (or waiver)  
  - Mentorship program opt-in  
  - Provisional certification status  

#### **Acceptance Criteria**  
1. [ ] System shows "Junior Member" option during registration if:  
   - Graduation date â‰¤ 1 year ago (verified via degree upload)  
   - Work experience section empty or <2 years  
2. [ ] Auto-enables:  
   - Access to beginner-level CPD courses  
   - "Find a Mentor" dashboard button  
3. [ ] Disables:  
   - Senior certification applications  
   - Equipment auditing functions  

#### **Technical Implementation**  
```php
// Registration logic snippet
if ($graduationDate >= now()->subYear() && $workExperience < 2) {
  $accountType = 'junior';
  applyDiscount(100%); // Fee waiver
  enableFeature('mentorship_program');
}
```

#### **Workflow**  
1. Adam selects "I'm a recent graduate" during signup  
2. System prompts for:  
   - University name & graduation proof  
   - Career goals (dropdown: Academia/Industry/Government)  
3. Profile is created with:  
   - "Junior" badge  
   - Checklist for career progression  

#### **Edge Cases**  
- **International Graduates:** Accept provisional registration pending credential evaluation  
- **Career Changers:** Allow junior status with relevant retraining certificates  
- **Inactive Accounts:** Auto-downgrade to "Student" if no CPD hours in 12 months

### **Impact on Existing System**  
| Component | Modification Required |  
|-----------|-----------------------|  
| Registration Form | Add "Career Stage" selector |  
| Pricing Module | Junior-tier pricing rules |  
| Permission System | New role-based limitations |  
| Dashboard | Add progression tracker widget |

### **Connected Stories**  
- **US-22:** *As a junior member, I want to see my path to Professional certification...*  
- **US-23:** *As a mentor, I want to filter junior mentees by specialization...*  

Would you like me to:  
1. Design the junior member dashboard view?  
2. Specify API endpoints for graduation date verification?  
3. Create the mentorship matching algorithm?
