    - User submits tractor safety inspection reports with calibration dates.

14. **CPD Hour Logging**  
    - Member claims 15 hours for a soil management workshop.

15. **Disaster Response Mode**  
    - System fast-tracks certifications for engineers in flood-affected regions.

---

### **F. Integration Scenarios**
16. **University API Verification**  
    - System auto-verifies a degree by querying the university's registry.

17. **Payment for Certification**  
    - User pays $200 via Stripe, triggering application processing.

18. **Digital Badge Issuance**  
    - System pushes a new certification to the user's Credly account.

---

### **G. Reporting**
19. **Annual Membership Audit**  
    - Admin generates a report of all expiring certifications for email reminders.

20. **Skills Gap Analysis**  
    - System identifies that 60% of members lack precision agriculture training.

---

### **Special Case: Edge Scenarios**
- **Foreign Credential Evaluation**  
  - Nigerian engineer submits translated documents for equivalency assessment.

- **Posthumous Recognition**  
  - Family requests legacy status for a deceased member's contributions.

- **Mass Migration Event**  
  - System imports refugee engineers' credentials with reduced documentation.

### **Use Case Template Example**
```markdown
**Use Case UC-04:** Upload Degree Certificate  
**Actor:** Member  
**Preconditions:** Logged in, profile ≥50% complete  
**Flow:**  
1. User clicks "Add Qualification"  
2. Selects "University Degree" type  
3. Uploads PDF (max 10MB)  
4. System extracts institution/dates via OCR  
5. User confirms auto-filled data  
6. Status set to "Pending Verification"  
**Exceptions:**  
- Invalid file type → Show error  
- OCR failure → Manual entry fallback  
```

### **Next Steps**
1. Should we:  
   - [ ] Prioritize use cases for MVP development?  
   - [ ] Create detailed sequence diagrams for complex flows?  
   - [ ] Define acceptance criteria for each case?  

2. Would you like me to:  
   - Develop templates for all 20 use cases?  
   - Suggest error handling for edge scenarios?  
   - Align these with your earlier requirements?  

These use cases cover functional, regulatory, and exceptional scenarios unique to agricultural engineering professionals. Let me know how you'd like to refine them!
