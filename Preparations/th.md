I've created a professional registration application for agricultural engineers with a dark mode UI and green gradient accents. The app includes user registration, application forms, document uploads, and a dashboard for tracking application status.

What's next?
Refine & Customize: Tweak the design, animations, and layouts via prompts or visual edits.
Master Prompting: Use clear, detailed, and iterative prompts for better outcomes.
GitHub Sync: Transfer your project's code to GitHub for two-way sync of edits.
Debug with Ease: Activate our experimental "chat mode" to troubleshoot issues quickly.
Add project knowledge: Set key context or custom instructions you want to include in every edit in this project.
Need to save information, add user accounts, or connect with other services? Supabase is a simple way to add these features without complex technical setup.

I'm excited to build a Professional Registration Management System for Agricultural Engineers! This is a comprehensive project that will require careful planning and execution. Let me outline how I envision this application based on your requirements document.

Looking at agricultural engineering certification systems, I can draw inspiration from professional engineering organizations like ASABE (American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers) and similar professional registration platforms.

For this first version, I'll focus on creating the core functionality with a clean, professional design using a color palette inspired by agriculture (greens, earthy tones) combined with a modern, trustworthy interface suitable for professional accreditation.

Features I'll implement:
User authentication and registration system
Dashboard for users to track their certification progress
Profile management for personal information
Qualifications tracking (education, training, experience, publications)
Basic admin verification interface
Responsive design for all devices
Design Style:
Professional and clean with agricultural themed elements
Color palette: Green (#2E7D32), dark green (#1B5E20), earth tones (#8D6E63), complemented by white and light gray for clean content areas
Modern and intuitive interface with clear navigation
Emphasis on progress tracking and document management
Let's create the application!
